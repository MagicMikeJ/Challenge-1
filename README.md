# Challenge-1. Code Refactor Starter Code

## Things that I was able to learn and accomplish in Challenge-1.

As per the challenge outine, I made changes to by replacing several _div_ tags and using _semantic_ **_HTML_** _elements_. I was able to implement _nav_ tags, _section_ tags and _alt_ tags. After making the changes to these tags in the **HTML**, I had to make changes to the **CSS**. These changes included omitting the dot (.) within every style pertaining to the _header_ and the _footer_ in the **CSS**.

I changed the _<\_title_>_ element from _"website"_ to the name of the clients company, **"Horiseon"** as well as a _".com"_ to the _<_title_>_. I added brief descriptors within every _<_alt_>""_ tag as well.

I had to add an _id=_ tag to the _"navigation link" <\_nav_>_ for the _search-engine-optimization link icon_ due to the link not functioning.

I added descriptors to my **HTML** such as _<_!-- _navigation_ --_>_ and _<_!-- _Unordered list element_ --_>_. Please refer to the **HTML** to see the other descriptors. Within the **CSS**, there are descriptors such as _/* Apply styles to <*header*> */_, and, _/* Apply styles to <*footer*> */_ which I added. I learned that when using descriptors in both **HTML** and **CSS**, they start and end differently from each other, ie; _<*--...--*>_ for **HTML** and _/* ...... <...> */_ for **CSS**.

In **_CHALLENGE-1_**, I was able to create my _README.md_ file in **GitHub** and, for the first time since enrolling it this **Coding Bootcamp**, I performed a **Pull** from my repository to the directory, opened the file and wrote my _README.md_ for **_CHALLENGE-1_** in **VS Code**.

This was a great challenge to see how making changes to the **HTML** affects the overall appearance in the website and then having to make the necessary changes within the **CSS**
